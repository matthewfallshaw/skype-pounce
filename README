I turned off most of Skype's pesky notifications. This pair of scripts allows 
you to be notified when a particular user becomes available. Since it is 
separate from the Skype application its settings can be customised individually 
in the Growl preference pane. I have mine set to play a sound and show the 
notification as a bezel.

It probably isn't necessary for this to be two seperate scripts. At some point
I should look in to consolidating them into one AppleScript or one Ruby scirpt.
Probably the former.
